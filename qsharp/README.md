# Q# Operations

This directory contains Q# operations that will be called from Python via qsharp-chemistry.

## Files

- `estimate.qs`: Stub operation for resource estimation (placeholder for future implementation)

## Future Implementation

This will be replaced with actual quantum chemistry operations that:
1. Load Broombridge files
2. Execute quantum algorithms
3. Interface with Azure Quantum Resource Estimator
